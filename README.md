Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis
Objective: Transforming raw retail data into actionable business strategies using Power BI.

📖 Executive Summary
This project analyzes the performance of a multi-national retail corporation ("Superstore"). While the company shows strong top-line revenue, the primary goal was to identify "profit leaks" where high sales volume was actually resulting in a net loss. By analyzing the relationship between sales, geography, and discounting strategies, this report provides a roadmap to reclaim lost margins.

📊 The Storyboard (Dashboard Structure)
The report is structured into a single-page executive dashboard designed for a Z-pattern reading flow:

The Hook (Top-Left): High-level KPI cards showing $2.3M Total Sales and $286K Total Profit.

The Context (Middle): A time-series line chart showing a massive Q4 holiday spike, indicating a heavy reliance on year-end sales.

The Conflict (Center): A bar chart comparing Profit vs. Sales across sub-categories. This reveals the "villain" of the story: Tables.

The Resolution (Bottom): A geographic map and a "Smart Narrative" text box that explains the specific action items needed to fix the losses.

💡 Key Business Insights
The Discount Trap: Analysis reveals that the Furniture category is significantly underperforming. Specifically, the Tables sub-category is operating at a $17,725 net loss despite having over $200k in sales.

Root Cause: The loss is directly correlated with aggressive discounting. In the Central Region, average discounts often exceed 20%, which "eats" the entire profit margin.

High-Margin Heroes: Conversely, Technology (Copiers & Accessories) produces the highest profit per unit. These segments should be the primary focus of marketing spend.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the data, the following business actions are recommended:

Discount Capping: Implement an immediate 15% maximum discount cap on all Furniture items to move the category toward a break-even point.

Regional Optimization: Review pricing strategies in Texas and Illinois, as these states represent the highest concentration of unprofitable sales.

Inventory Shift: Reallocate warehouse space from low-margin "Supplies" to high-margin "Technology" products to improve overall ROI.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Tools: Power BI Desktop, Power Query.

Data Modeling: Implemented a star-schema inspired model for efficient filtering.

Visual Design: Applied Conditional Formatting (Red/Green logic) to instantly highlight unprofitable categories, following best practices in data storytelling.
